This is a simple tutorial on GitHub. You have tonnes of stuff and tutorials on git and gitHub.

A Project in github is referenced by the user it is hosted by along with the repository it is hosted in. A project hosted by tinut in GitHubTutorial will reside at https://github.com/tinut/GitHubTutorial. First step to collaborate with a project is to find the GitHub copy of the project. This might require permissions from repo owners.

Once you have found the repository which you want to collaborate, you can fork the github project on to your account using fork button. This creates a repository of same name under your username. 

Another thing you could do is clone the project into your local system. For the purpose of this tutorial, you can clone GitHubTutorial project.
git clone https://github.com/tinut/GitHubTutorial
